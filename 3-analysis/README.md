# Analysis of the Tool Support
This project answers the following research question:
> How existing tools support the SPL activities and variability modeling characteristics required by the case studies identified in RQ1?

The objective is to empirically analyzing the most usable SPL tools. 
We use a running case study based on an SPL process for Functional Quality Attributes ([WeaFQAs](https://hdl.handle.net/10630/17231)) with demanding characteristics such as clonable features, variable features, attributes, huge feature models, and so on.
This project contains the artifacts developed in different SPL tools to carry out the [WeaFQAs](https://hdl.handle.net/10630/17231) SPL process.

Variability model of the [Functional Quality Attributes (FQAs)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2017.10.018):

## Main Artifacts
* The FQAs variability model in different formats.
* The FQAs software architecture implemented with different variability approaches.
* The FQAs software architecture in UML.
* Other artifacts like model to model transformations that implement specific variation points (e.g., *ObjectExistence* in CVL).

**Note:** Further information about the artifacts as well as other specific artifacts of each tool can be consulted in each project below:
