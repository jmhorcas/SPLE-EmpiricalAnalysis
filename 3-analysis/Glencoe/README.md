# Glencoe
The FQAs variability model modeled in the [Glencoe](https://glencoe.hochschule-trier.de/) tool and exported in several formats (GFM, v.control, pure::variants, Excel, SPASS, and DIMACS).  
**Note:** This is a partial version of the complete FQAs variability model that can be found in [S.P.L.O.T.](./SPLOT/). We are currently working on completing the Glencoe version of the FQAs variability model.

## Artifacts
* The [FQAs feature model](FQAs-partial-variabilitymodel.gfm.json) in GFM format.
* The [FQAs feature model](FQAs-variabilitymodel.xmi) in v.control format.
* The [FQAs feature model](FQAs-variabilitymodel.xfm) in pure::variants format.
* The [FQAs feature model](FQAs-variabilitymodel.xlsx) in Excel format.
* The [FQAs feature model](FQAs-variabilitymodel.spass) in SPASS format.
* The [FQAs feature model](FQAs-variabilitymodel.cnf) in DIMACS format.

## Procedure
Here are the instructions to manage and work with the FQAs variability model in Glencoe:

To open Glencoe, load the [official website of Glencoe](https://glencoe.hochschule-trier.de/) in a Internet browser and clic on the `Get Started` button to launch the online application.

###### Import the variability model in Glencoe:

2. Select and open the GFM format of the FQAs variability model ([FQAs-partial-variabilitymodel.gfm.json](FQAs-partial-variabilitymodel.gfm.json)).

###### Modify, save, and export the variability model:
1. In Glencoe, clic on the `+` button to create a new empty model, or clic on any existing feature to modify it or add child features.
2. The model can be saved by exporting it to different formats. To do that, clic on the `EXPORT` tab on the left-side and select the desired format. The file will be automatically downloaded.

###### Analyze the variability model:
To analyze the model and obtain statistics, metrics, issues, and other information:

1. In Glencoe, clic on the `ANALYSIS` dropdown menu and select the desired kind of analysis (e.g., All, Consistency, Common Features, Dead Features, Possible Configurations).
2. An automatic popup will appear with the information of the analysis.
3. Metrics, a list of features, constraints, and issues appear by default in the right-side pane.
