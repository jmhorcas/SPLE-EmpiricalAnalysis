# Case studies requirements
The review of case studies and domains answer the following research question:
> Which SPL activities and variability modeling characteristics are required by existing case studies in the SPL community?

We answer this question by surveying and analyzing both industry and academic case studies, looking for real variability requirements and practical uses of the SPL concepts and variability mechanisms. We group the case studies by application domains. Our main purpose is to establish whether there is a real necessity of using advance mechanisms to manage variability or not. Thus, we are especially interested in those domains that pose the most challenging requirements.

This project contains the following artifacts to replicate and/or improve the survey:
