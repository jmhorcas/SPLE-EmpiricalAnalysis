31/01/2019 16:41:41,José Miguel,FeatureHouse,"FeatureHouse is a general approach to the composition of software artifacts. FeatureHouse is language-independent in that software artifacts written in various languages can be composed, e.g., source code, test cases, models, documentation, and makefiles. Software artifacts are represented as feature structure trees (FSTs), which capture the essence of an artifact's modular structure in the form of a tree. As composition paradigm, FeatureHouse supports two approaches: superimposition and three-way merge. FeatureHouse consists of a tool for superimposition, called FSTComposer, a tool for three-way merge, called FSTMerge, and a plug-in and generation mechanism for integrating new languages automatically, called FSTGenerator. FeatureHouse can be used with the visual development environment FeatureIDE.",http://www.fosd.de/fh,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6095570,Product Derivation (PD),Academic,28/03/2008,25/03/2017,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,FeatureIDE

Lightweight modeling aims at improving the understanding of the problem domain in the early stages of software development and determining the requirements with fewer defects. Lightweight modeling has proven cost effective in finding bugs and improving network protocol specifications. Clafer's goal is to make lightweight modeling more accessible to a wider range of users and domains, including enterprise systems.",https://www.clafer.org/,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2499777.2499779,"Domain Analysis (DA), Requirements Analysis (RA)",Academic,1/01/2014,1/02/2018,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,

Its aim is to support programmers of software product lines by improving the usability of the development tool. The basic concept of Feature Commander is to process the preprocessor-based feature-assignments in the code (e.g. #ifdef or #endif statements) and display this information in other visual representations. For each feature, the user can easily assign a color, which is used throughout all visualizations. When a Feature has no assigned color, it is displayed with a shade of gray. This shows the Feature exists, but it does not get the users attention. There are three views: the Code View, the Explorer View and the Feature Model View. Each view helps the user in finding feature-based files or code fragments or getting a better understanding of the code.",http://fosd.net/fc,,Domain Implementation (DI),,17/09/2010,,No,Yes,No,Yes,
